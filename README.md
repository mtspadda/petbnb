# PetMinder

This is a frontend made to study **reactJS** with MUI(https://mui.com/material-ui/) as an alternative to angular, .  The main idea is to build a frontend to a Saas for Pet Sitters(Minders), the goal is also to use the OpenLayersMap (https://openlayers.org/) to pin locations of users and, in future make it consume a backend.
And I'm using ZED(https://zed.dev/) for this one, just to give it a try.


## Location search
Using OpenLayersMap and Nominatim autocomplete
